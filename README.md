#Created From Scratch

This project was made from Scratch, since my Student Number is 100795120, with an accumulation of 25, I am ODD making me have the designated game of PAC-MAN.

Since we are supposed to create a Low-fidelity scene, the implementation from scratch would be more meaningful as creating own navigation system and movement would allow me to resemble the movement of Pac-Man. Furthermore with the design patterns we have to implement this would help createing only the instances needed for the ghosts and pellets to make it look like a level out of Pac-Man.
